# DeleteDupeFiles
Delete files in the target directory of the same size with name differing only by suffix, like "*.1.mp3"

I, once, accidentally copied gigs and gigs of MP3s into the same folder structure and ended up with myriad files of the form *.1.mp3. I tired a few products reviewed on HowToGeek.com (http://www.howtogeek.com/200962/how-to-find-and-remove-duplicate-files-on-windows/) and while I liked Duplicate File Finder (http://doubles.sourceforge.net/) the most, none of them met my needs. Primarily, I needed something to zero in on dupliciate files validated by file size and name similarity and quickly delete the superflouous onces without interaction from me. This does that. Some possible improvements:

1. Wire up progress bar
2. Use Recycle Bin or have an option to move instead of delete files.
